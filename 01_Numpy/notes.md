# Numpy is multidiensional array library
# Numpy used Fixed types
# Faster to read less bytes of memory
# No type checking when iterating through objects

# Numpy uses contiguous Memory
# Example a=np.array([1,2,4])

# APPLICATIONS
# mathematics (MATLAB replacement)
# plotting (Matplotlib)
# Backend    (pandas, Connect 4,Digital photography)
# Machine Learning
